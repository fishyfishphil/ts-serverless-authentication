# TypeScript Serverless Authentication library

This package contains common functions for [Serverless Authentication boilerplate](https://github.com/SansDeus/ts-serverless-authentication-boilerplate) and oauth2 provider packages it uses.

Refactored in Typescript 4.0.2 with minimal external/dev packages.

This package is constantly being updated as I work through converting the boilerplate library.

If you notice issues, please log them on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/SansDeus/ts-serverless-authentication-boilerplate/issues) . Thanks!
